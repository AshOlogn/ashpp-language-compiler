This file just contains notes I periodically take as part of the brainstorming
process and is roughly divided into the different sections of compilation, with
each section elaborating on design decisions, etc.

This document will be changed arbitrarily and isn't a formal record of my work
on the compiler.

I plan on making a "commercial" and personal version of the compiler. In the personal
one, I implement everything manually (lexer, parser, etc.) myself just to learn the
OCaml language better. In the commercial one, I use existing tools like ocamlyacc.

Lexer
  - Read a .app file into a string
  - Convert the file into a list of tokens (variant type)
      - token type
      - attributes
      - line number range (for debugging)
    
  - Make a version with ocamllex, one without (for practice)

This file just contains notes I periodically take as part of the brainstorming
process and is roughly divided into the different sections of compilation, with
each section elaborating on design decisions, etc.

This document will be changed arbitrarily and isn't a formal record of my work
on the compiler.

Lexer
  - Read a .ash file into a string
  - Convert the file into a list of tokens
      - token type
      - attributes
      - line number range (for debugging)

  - Make a version with ocamllex, one without (for practice)
